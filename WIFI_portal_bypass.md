# How to bypass the Comcast WIFI portal

## Introduction
Comcast customers get a nice benefit: wherever there is an SSID of xfinitywifi, you can attach to it,
enter your Comcast user/password credentials and get free WIFI.  The catch is that your device has to
have the ability to display a browser so you can actually enter your user/password credentials.

But once your device is authenticated, you attach to another xfinitywifi SSID in another place without
having to enter your credentials.

However, this does not work for most smart TVs or other simple devices (i.e., ones that do not have a
browser).  So you cannot use xfinitywifi.

## Solution theory
Comcast stores the MAC address of each device that was authenticated.  Once that MAC address is stored,
it is authenticated and does not have to enter a user/password.  The trick is to get that MAC address
stored in Comcast's database on your account.

These steps have been blanked out to avoid certain legal issues.
